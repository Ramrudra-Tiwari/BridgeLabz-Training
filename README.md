## Week-3 Data-Structure
---
## Day 1: LinkedList
**📅 02 January 2026** 
- created new branch name "dsa-practice"
- solved many problem based on linkedlist
- Solved practice problems and enchance the feature
- Pushed solutions to GitHub
- Code Link: [dsa-practice(linkedlist)](https://github.com/Ramrudra-Tiwari/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/dsa-practice/dsa-practice/gcr-codebase/DSAPractice/src/com/linkedlist)

## Day 2: Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Function
**📅 03 January 2026**
- Worked on "dsa-practice" and "java-oops-practice" branch
- Solved many problem based on stack and queue 
- Introduced to Stack and Queue, including their working principles and real-world use cases. 
- Learned Stack operations (push, pop, peek) and Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, front).
- Explored HashMap concepts, including key-value pairs and efficient data retrieval.
- Understood the Hashing Function, collision handling, and its role in optimizing search operations.
- Pushed solution to GitHub
- Code Link: [dsa-practice(stackqueueandhash)](https://github.com/Ramrudra-Tiwari/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/dsa-practice/dsa-practice/gcr-codebase/DSAPractice/src/com/stackqueueandhash)

## Day 3: Sorting Algorithms
**📅 05 January 2026**
- Worked on "dsa-practice" and "java-oops-practice" branch
- Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a specific order for efficient processing.
- This module covers Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort implemented in Java.
- This module covers Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort implemented in Java.
- Additional sorting techniques like Selection, Heap, Counting, Radix, and Bucket Sort are explored for comparison.
- These implementations help understand algorithm efficiency and real-world use cases.
- Solved many problem based on sorting algorithm
- Pushed solution to GitHub
- Code Link: [dsa-practice(sorting)](https://github.com/Ramrudra-Tiwari/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/dsa-practice/dsa-practice/gcr-codebase/DSAPractice/src/com/sorting/algorithms)
